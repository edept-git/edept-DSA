### Description

Given two integers, `a` and `b`, find the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`.  This is the modulo operation (%).

### Constraints

- `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000`
- `b > 0`

### Example

**Input:**
`a = 17`
`b = 5`

**Output:**
`2`  (Because 17 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 2)
