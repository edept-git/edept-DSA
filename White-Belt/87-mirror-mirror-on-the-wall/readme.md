### Description
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. For example, "madam" or "racecar" are palindromes.

Your task is to write a program that takes a single string as input and determines if it is a palindrome. The program should output "Yes" if the string is a palindrome, and "No" otherwise.

### Constraints
*   The input string `s` will consist of lowercase English letters.
*   `1 <= len(s) <= 1000`

### Example
#### Input:
`level`
#### Output:
`Yes`

#### Input:
`hello`
#### Output:
`No`

### Concepts Covered
*   String manipulation
*   Looping (e.g., `while` or `for` loops)
*   Conditional statements (`if/else`)
*   Two-pointer technique
*   Basic string indexing
