### Description
Welcome, future DSA expert! Your first mission is to build a friendly "Greeting Machine." You'll be given a person's name, and your program needs to generate a personalized greeting message. This exercise is all about understanding how to use **parameters** to pass information into a function and **arguments** as the actual values supplied when calling that function.

Imagine you have a robot that says "Hello, [name]! Welcome to DSA!". You need to teach your program to take a name, use it to complete the greeting, and then display the full message.

### Constraints
*   The input `name` will be a single word (no spaces).
*   The `name` will consist only of English alphabet characters (a-z, A-Z).
*   The length of the `name` will be between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.

### Example
#### Input:
`Alice`

#### Output:
`Hello, Alice! Welcome to DSA!`

### Concepts Covered
*   **Functions/Methods**: Defining and calling reusable blocks of code.
*   **Parameters**: Variables listed in a function's definition that receive input values.
*   **Arguments**: The actual values passed to a function when it is called.
*   **Basic I/O**: Reading input from the user and printing output.
*   **String Concatenation**: Combining multiple strings into a single string.
