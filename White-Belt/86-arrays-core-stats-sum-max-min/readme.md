### Description
You've just started your journey into the world of data structures, and arrays are your first stop! Your task is to write a program that takes a list of integers and calculates three fundamental statistics: the sum of all its elements, the maximum value present in the array, and the minimum value present in the array.

This exercise will help you get comfortable with iterating through arrays and performing basic aggregate operations.

### Constraints
*   The input array `arr` will contain between 1 and 1000 integers (inclusive).
*   Each integer `arr[i]` will be between -10000 and 10000 (inclusive).
*   The input will always consist of valid integers.
*   The array will never be empty.

### Example
#### Input:
`5`
`5 2 8 1 9`

*(The first line indicates the number of elements, the second line contains the elements themselves, separated by spaces.)*

#### Output:
`Sum: 25, Max: 9, Min: 1`

### Concepts Covered
*   Arrays
*   Iteration (loops like `for` or `while`)
*   Variables for accumulating sums and tracking maximum/minimum values
*   Conditional statements (e.g., `if` statements) for comparison
*   Basic arithmetic operations
*   Input/Output operations
