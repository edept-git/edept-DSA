### Description
Your task is to write a program that takes a given string and reverses the order of its characters. For example, if the input is "hello", the output should be "olleh". This is a fundamental problem that helps build a strong understanding of string manipulation and iteration.

### Constraints
*   The input string will contain printable ASCII characters (letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces).
*   The length of the input string will be between 0 and 1000 characters, inclusive.
*   An empty string should remain an empty string.

### Example

Input: hello
Output: olleh



Input: world
Output: dlrow



Input: Programming Is Fun!
Output: !nuF sI gnimmargorP


### Concepts Covered
*   Strings (character sequences)
*   Iteration (using loops like `for` or `while`)
*   Pointers or indices for accessing characters
*   Swapping elements (characters in this case)
*   Handling immutable vs. mutable strings (language-dependent)
