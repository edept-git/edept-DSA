### Description
You are given two integers, `a` and `b`, and a modulus `m`. Your task is to calculate the sum of `a` and `b`, and then find the remainder when this sum is divided by `m`. In mathematical terms, you need to compute `(a + b) % m`.

### Constraints
* `0 <= a, b <= 10^9`
* `1 <= m <= 10^9`

### Example
#### Input:
5
7
3

#### Output:
0

#### Explanation:
Here, `a = 5`, `b = 7`, and `m = 3`. 
First, calculate the sum: `a + b = 5 + 7 = 12`.
Then, find the remainder when 12 is divided by 3: `12 % 3 = 0`.
So, the output is `0`.
