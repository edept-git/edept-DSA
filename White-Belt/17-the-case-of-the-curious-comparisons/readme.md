### Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, determine the number of comparisons needed to find the minimum element in the array in the best, worst, and average cases.

### Constraints

- The array will contain at least one element.
- The elements of the array are integers.
- Assume the average case is the case when the minimum element is in the middle of the array

### Example

Input: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
Output: Best Case: 0, Worst Case: 7, Average Case: 4

### Concepts Covered

- Best, Worst, and Average Case Analysis
- Linear Search
