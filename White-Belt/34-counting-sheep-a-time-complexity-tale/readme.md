### Description
Given an integer `n`, count the number of sheep from 1 to n.  This seems simple, but let's analyze its time and space complexity!

### Constraints
- `n` will be a non-negative integer.

### Example
Input: 5
Output: 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)

### Concepts Covered
- Time Complexity (Big O Notation)
- Space Complexity (Big O Notation)
- Basic iteration
