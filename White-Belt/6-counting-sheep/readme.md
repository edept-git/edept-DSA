### Description
Given an integer `n`, count the number of sheep from 1 to n.  This seems simple, but we'll focus on understanding the time complexity.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000

### Example
Input: 5
Output: 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15)

### Concepts Covered
- Time Complexity (Big O Notation)
- Basic Arithmetic
