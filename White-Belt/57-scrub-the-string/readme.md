### Description
You are given a string `s` and a character `charToRemove`. Your task is to remove all occurrences of `charToRemove` from `s` and return the new string.

For example, if `s = "hello world"` and `charToRemove = 'l'`, the result should be `"heo word"`.

### Constraints
* The input string `s` will consist of ASCII characters.
* The length of `s` will be between 0 and 1000 characters.
* The `charToRemove` will be a single ASCII character.
* The removal is case-sensitive.

### Example

Input:
string s = "programming"
char charToRemove = 'g'

Output:
"proammin"


### Concepts Covered
* String iteration (looping through characters)
* Conditional logic (checking if a character matches)
* Building a new string (or character array) from selected characters
* Basic string data types and operations
