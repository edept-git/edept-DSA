### Description
Your task is to implement a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where the case of each alphabetic character is swapped. This means all lowercase letters should become uppercase, and all uppercase letters should become lowercase. Non-alphabetic characters (numbers, symbols, spaces) should remain unchanged.

### Constraints
*   The input string will have a length between 0 and 100 characters, inclusive.
*   The string will consist of ASCII characters.

### Example
**Input:** `Hello World!`
**Output:** `hELLO wORLD!`

### Concepts Covered
*   String iteration
*   Conditional logic (if/else statements)
*   Character case checking (e.g., `is_lower`, `is_upper`)
*   Character case conversion (e.g., `to_lower`, `to_upper`)
