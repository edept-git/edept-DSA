### Description
You are given a list (or array) of whole numbers. Your task is to find the single largest number within this list. For example, if the list is `[3, 1, 7, 4, 2]`, the largest number is `7`.

### Constraints
*   The input array will contain at least one element.
*   The number of elements in the array (N) will be between 1 and 1000.
*   Each element in the array will be an integer between -1000 and 1000.

### Concepts Covered
*   **Iteration:** How to go through each item in a list.
*   **Comparison:** How to check if one number is greater than another.
*   **Variables:** Storing and updating a value (like the current maximum).
*   **Time Complexity (O(N)):** Understanding that we might need to look at every item once.
*   **Space Complexity (O(1)):** Understanding that we don't need a lot of extra memory, regardless of the list's size.
