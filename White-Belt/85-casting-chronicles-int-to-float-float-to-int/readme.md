### Description
Welcome, White Belt coder! In this problem, you'll explore the fundamental concept of "type casting," which is how you convert data from one type to another. You will be given two numbers: an integer and a floating-point number (decimal). Your task is to perform two specific type conversions and print the results.

Specifically, you need to:
1. Convert the given integer into a floating-point number.
2. Convert the given floating-point number into an integer.

Pay attention to how different languages handle these conversions and potential data loss when converting from a floating-point number to an integer.

### Constraints
- The input integer `N` will be within the range of standard integer types (e.g., -2 * 10^9 to 2 * 10^9).
- The input floating-point number `D` will be within the range of standard double/float types (e.g., -10^18 to 10^18).
- Inputs will always be valid numbers.

### Example
**Input:**
15
5.75

**Output:**
15.000000
5

_Note: The number of decimal places for the float output might vary slightly by language, but the value should be equivalent. We will aim for 6 decimal places where possible._

### Concepts Covered
- Primitive Data Types (Integer, Floating-point numbers like `double` or `float`)
- Type Casting (Implicit and Explicit Conversions)
- Input/Output Operations
