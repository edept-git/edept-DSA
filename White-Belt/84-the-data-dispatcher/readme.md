### Description
You've just landed your first programming gig, and your task is to help the "Data Dispatcher" system. This system needs to read three distinct pieces of information: an integer, a floating-point number, and a single word (string). After reading them, your program must display them back to the user in a specific, structured format, and then combine the word with the integer.

Your goal is to demonstrate your understanding of different data types and how to store and display their values.

### Constraints
- The integer will be a standard 32-bit integer (e.g., between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647).
- The floating-point number will be a standard double-precision float.
- The word will be a single string consisting of alphanumeric characters, with a maximum length of 50 characters.
- Your program must handle input from standard input (stdin) and print output to standard output (stdout).

### Example
#### Input:

10
3.14
Hello


#### Output:

Integer: 10
Float: 3.140000
Word: Hello
Combined: Hello_10

(Note: The floating-point number should be displayed with exactly 6 decimal places.)

### Concepts Covered
- Variable Declaration
- Integer Data Type
- Floating-Point Data Type (float/double)
- String Data Type (character arrays or string objects)
- Basic Input/Output Operations (reading from stdin, printing to stdout)
