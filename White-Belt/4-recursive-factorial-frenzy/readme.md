### Description

Write a function that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

### Constraints

- The input integer n will be non-negative (0 or greater).
- The input integer n will be less than or equal to 12 (to avoid potential integer overflow).

### Example

Input: 5
Output: 120

### Concepts Covered

- Recursion
- Base Cases
- Factorial Calculation
