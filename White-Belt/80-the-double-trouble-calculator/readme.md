### Description
You need to write a program that calculates a "doubled sum". Specifically, your program should read two integers, calculate their sum, and then multiply that sum by 2. This core logic must be encapsulated within a function. Your main program will read the inputs, call this function, and print the result.

### Constraints
- The input integers `num1` and `num2` will be between -1000 and 1000.

### Example
Input:
5
3

Output:
16

Explanation:
First, the sum of 5 and 3 is 8.
Then, 8 is multiplied by 2, resulting in 16.

### Concepts Covered
- Function Definition: How to declare and define your own functions.
- Function Call: How to execute a defined function and pass arguments to it.
- Parameters and Return Values: Understanding how information goes into and out of functions.
- Basic Input/Output: Reading data from the user and printing results.
- Basic Arithmetic Operations.
