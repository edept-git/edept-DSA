### Description

Given an integer `n`, count the total number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).

### Constraints

* 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6

### Example

Input: n = 3
Output: 4

Explanation:
1: 1 (1 set bit)
2: 10 (1 set bit)
3: 11 (2 set bits)
Total set bits = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
