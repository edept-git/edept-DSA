### Description
You are tasked with writing a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers up to a given positive integer `N`, inclusive. For example, if `N` is 7, the even numbers within the range [1, 7] are 2, 4, and 6, and their sum is 12.

### Constraints
* `1 <= N <= 1000`

### Example
**Input:**

7

**Output:**

12


### Concepts Covered
*   **Loops:** `for` or `while` loops to iterate through a sequence of numbers.
*   **Conditional Statements:** `if` statements to check if a number meets a specific condition (e.g., being even).
*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition and the modulus operator (`%`) for checking divisibility.
