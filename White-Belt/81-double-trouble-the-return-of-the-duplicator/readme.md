### Description
You've been hired by a magical shop that specializes in duplicating items! Your first task is to write a program that calculates the "doubled value" of any given integer.

Specifically, you need to create a function that takes one integer as input, multiplies it by 2, and then returns the result. Your `main` (or equivalent) function should read an integer, call your duplicating function, and print the returned doubled value.

### Constraints
*   The input integer `N` will be between -1000 and 1000, inclusive.

### Example
#### Input:

5

#### Output:

10


#### Explanation:
The input is 5. When passed to the duplicating function, it calculates 5 * 2 = 10. The function then returns 10, which is printed.

### Concepts Covered
*   **Functions:** Defining and calling functions.
*   **Parameters:** Passing arguments to functions.
*   **Return Values:** Understanding how functions return a value and how to use it.
*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Simple multiplication.
*   **Input/Output:** Reading input and printing output.
