### Description

Given an integer `n`, count the number of sheep from 1 to n.  This sounds simple, but let's analyze its efficiency!

### Constraints

- `n` will be a non-negative integer.

### Example

Input: 5
Output: 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15)

### Concepts Covered

- Time Complexity (Big O Notation)
- Introduction to loops and iterative processes
