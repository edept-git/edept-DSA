### Description
You will be given a string `s` and a single character `c`. Your task is to count how many times the character `c` appears in the string `s`. The count should be case-sensitive.

### Constraints
*   The input string `s` will consist of printable ASCII characters (excluding spaces).
*   The length of `s` will be between 1 and 1000 characters.
*   The target character `c` will be a single printable ASCII character.
*   The count is case-sensitive (e.g., 'a' is different from 'A').

### Example
#### Example 1:
Input:
s = "programming"
c = 'g'
Output:
2

#### Example 2:
Input:
s = "Apple"
c = 'a'
Output:
0

### Concepts Covered
*   String iteration
*   Character comparison
*   Basic loops (for, while)
