### Description
Given two integers, `a` and `b`, determine if setting the least significant bit of `a` to 1 and clearing the least significant bit of `b` results in `a` being greater than `b`.

### Constraints
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.

### Example
Input: a = 5, b = 6
Output: true

(Because 5 with its least significant bit set to 1 is 5 | 1 = 5, and 6 with its least significant bit cleared is 6 & ~1 = 4. 5 > 4, hence true.)

### Concepts Covered
Bitwise operators, specifically OR and AND, conditional statements.
