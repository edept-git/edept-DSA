### Description
You are given three positive integers: `a`, `b`, and `m`. Your task is to find the sum of `a` and `b`, and then calculate the remainder when this sum is divided by `m`. In mathematical terms, you need to compute `(a + b) % m`.

### Constraints
*   `1 <= a, b, m <= 1000`

### Example
**Input:**
`a = 5`
`b = 7`
`m = 5`

**Output:**
`2`

**Explanation:**
First, calculate the sum: `5 + 7 = 12`.
Next, find the remainder when `12` is divided by `5`: `12 % 5 = 2`.
