### Description
You are given two positive integers, `a` and `b`. Your task is to find their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM).

The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. For example, the GCD of 12 and 18 is 6.

The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers. For example, the LCM of 12 and 18 is 36.

You need to output both GCD and LCM for the given pair of numbers.

### Constraints
