### Description
You're given a list of `N` integers. Your task is to read these integers, store them in a 1D array, and then print them out in reverse order, with each number separated by a space.

### Constraints
*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `-1000 <= element <= 1000` (Each integer in the list)

### Example
#### Sample Input

5
10 20 30 40 50


#### Sample Output

50 40 30 20 10


### Concepts Covered
*   1D Array Declaration
*   Reading input into an array (Array Traversal - Forward)
*   Printing elements from an array (Array Traversal - Reverse)
*   Basic Input/Output operations
