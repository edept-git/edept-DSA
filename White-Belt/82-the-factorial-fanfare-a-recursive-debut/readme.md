### Description
You're taking your first steps into the magical world of recursion! Your task is to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer `n`.

The factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.
For example:
`5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`
By definition, `0! = 1`.

You **must** solve this problem using recursion.

### Constraints
*   `0 <= n <= 12`
*   The input `n` will always be an integer.

### Example
**Input:**
3

**Output:**
6

**Explanation:**
The factorial of 3 is calculated as `3 * 2 * 1 = 6`.
