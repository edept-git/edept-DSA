### Description
You're given a positive integer `N`. Your task is to calculate the sum of all positive integers from 1 up to `N` (inclusive).

For example, if `N` is 3, the sum would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

### Constraints
* `1 <= N <= 1000`

### Example
#### Input:
3

#### Output:
6

### Concepts Covered
*   **Loops:** Using `for` or `while` loops to perform repetitive tasks.
*   **Variables:** Storing and updating a running total.
*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition.
*   **Time Complexity (Introduction):** Understanding how the number of operations scales with the input size (e.g., why a loop running `N` times is called O(N)).
*   **Space Complexity (Introduction):** Understanding how the amount of memory used scales with the input size (e.g., why using a few fixed variables is O(1)).
