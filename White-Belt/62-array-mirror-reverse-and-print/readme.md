### Description
You are given a list of `N` integers. Your task is to read these integers into a 1D array and then print them out in reverse order, separated by spaces.

For example, if the input integers are `10 20 30`, you should print `30 20 10`.

### Constraints
*   `1 <= N <= 100` (The number of integers will be between 1 and 100)
*   Each integer will be between `1` and `1000`.

### Example
#### Input:

3
10 20 30


#### Output:

30 20 10


### Concepts Covered
*   **1D Array Declaration:** How to declare a simple one-dimensional array to store multiple values of the same type.
*   **Array Initialization:** Assigning values to array elements.
*   **Array Traversal:** Iterating through an array to access or process its elements, both in forward and reverse order.
*   **Basic Input/Output:** Reading input from the console and printing output to the console.
