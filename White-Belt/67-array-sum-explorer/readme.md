### Description
You are given an array of integers. Your task is to calculate the sum of all its elements. This is a great starting point to understand how to iterate through data structures and analyze the resources your code uses.

### Constraints
* The array will contain between 1 and 100 integers, inclusive.
* Each integer in the array will be between -100 and 100, inclusive.

### Example
#### Input:

3
1 2 3


#### Output:

6


#### Explanation:
The array contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3. Their sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

### Concepts Covered
*   Basic Array Traversal / Iteration
*   Introduction to Time Complexity (O(N))
*   Introduction to Space Complexity (O(1))
