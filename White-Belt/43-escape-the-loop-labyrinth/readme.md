### Description

You're navigating a digital labyrinth represented as a list of integers.  Your goal is to find the sum of all even numbers, but you must avoid certain numbers (marked as -1). If you encounter a -1, skip it using 'continue', and if the sum exceeds 100, break out of the loop using 'break'.

### Constraints

- The input list will contain integers between -1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- The list's length will be at most 100.

### Example

Input: [2, 4, 6, -1, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
Output: 56

### Concepts Covered

- Loops ('for' loop)
- Conditional statements ('if')
- `break` and `continue` statements
