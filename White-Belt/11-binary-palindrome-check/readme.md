### Description

Given an integer, determine if its binary representation is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

### Constraints

- The input integer will be non-negative.

### Example

Input: 10
Output: true (Binary representation of 10 is 1010, which is a palindrome)

Input: 13
Output: false (Binary representation of 13 is 1101, which is not a palindrome)
