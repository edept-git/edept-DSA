### Description
Welcome, White Belt! In this problem, you'll practice one of the most fundamental concepts in programming: using variables to store different types of data and then displaying them. Your task is to read three distinct pieces of information from the user:
1. An integer number.
2. A floating-point number (a number with decimals).
3. A single word (a string).

After reading these inputs, you must store each of them in a variable of the appropriate data type. Finally, you will print all the stored values back to the console, following a specific format, and also show the integer value incremented by one.

### Constraints
*   The integer number will be between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
*   The floating-point number will be between 0.0 and 100.0 (inclusive).
*   The string will be a single word, containing only alphabetical characters, with a maximum length of 10 characters.

### Example
#### Input:

10
3.14
Hello


#### Output:

You entered:
Integer: 10
Float: 3.14
String: Hello
Next Integer: 11


### Concepts Covered
*   **Variables:** Declaring and using variables to store data.
*   **Data Types:** Understanding and utilizing fundamental data types like integers, floating-point numbers, and strings (or character arrays).
*   **Input/Output (I/O):** Reading data from standard input (keyboard) and writing data to standard output (console).
*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Performing simple operations like addition.
