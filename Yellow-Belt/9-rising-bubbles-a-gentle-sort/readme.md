### Description
You are tasked with sorting an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm. Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

Your program should read an integer `N`, followed by `N` integers representing the elements of the array. It should then apply Bubble Sort and print the sorted array.
