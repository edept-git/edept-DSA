### Description

Implement a naive pattern searching algorithm to find all occurrences of a pattern within a text string.  The algorithm should iterate through the text and compare each character to the pattern. If a mismatch occurs, it moves to the next character in the text. If a match is found, the index of the match is recorded.

### Constraints

- The text and pattern will only contain lowercase English alphabet characters ('a' - 'z').
- The pattern's length will be less than or equal to the text's length.
- The pattern can appear multiple times in the text, possibly overlapping.

### Example

Text: "abcabcabc"
Pattern: "abc"
Output: [0, 3, 6]

### Concepts Covered

- String manipulation
- Basic iteration
- Algorithm implementation
- Pattern matching
