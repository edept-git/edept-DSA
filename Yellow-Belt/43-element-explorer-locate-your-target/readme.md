### Description
You are given an array of integers `arr` and a target integer `target`. Your task is to implement a linear search algorithm to find the first index of the `target` in the `arr`. If the `target` is not found in the array, you should return `-1`.

### Constraints
*   `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
*   `-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
*   `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

### Example
**Example 1:**
Input:

arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9]
target = 7

Output:

2

Explanation: The target `7` is found at index `2` (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**
Input:

arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
target = 5

Output:

-1

Explanation: The target `5` is not found in the array.
