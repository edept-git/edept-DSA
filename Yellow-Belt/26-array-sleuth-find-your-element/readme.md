### Description
You are given an array of integers `arr` and a target integer `target`. Your task is to implement a function that finds the first occurrence of the `target` integer in the `arr` and returns its index. If the `target` is not found anywhere in the array, the function should return -1.

### Constraints
- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`

### Example
#### Input:

6
4 2 7 1 9 3
1

Explanation:
- The first line `6` indicates the size of the array.
- The second line `4 2 7 1 9 3` represents the elements of the array.
- The third line `1` is the target element to search for.

#### Output:

3

Explanation:
The number `1` is found at index `3` in the array (0-indexed).
