### Description
You are given an array of integers, `nums`. Your task is to find the sum of a contiguous subarray (a subarray that occupies consecutive positions within the original array) which has the largest sum. This subarray must contain at least one number.

For example, if the array is `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`, the contiguous subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]` has the largest sum, which is `6`.

### Constraints
* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Example
Input:

-2 1 -3 4 -1 2 1 -5 4

Output:

6

Explanation: The subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]` has the largest sum = 6.
