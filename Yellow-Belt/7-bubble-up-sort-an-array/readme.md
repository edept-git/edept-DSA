### Description
You are given an array of integers. Your task is to sort this array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

### Constraints
*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (where N is the number of elements in the array)
*   `-10^9 <= array[i] <= 10^9`
*   The array may contain duplicate elements.
