### Description
Given two strings, `s1` and `s2`, determine if `s2` is an anagram of `s1`. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams. The comparison should be case-sensitive and assume strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

### Constraints
*   `s1` and `s2` will consist of lowercase English letters ('a'-'z') only.
*   The length of both `s1` and `s2` will be between 1 and 1000 characters, inclusive.

### Example
**Input:**
s1 = "listen"
s2 = "silent"

**Output:**
true

**Explanation:**
Both strings contain the same characters ('l', 'i', 's', 't', 'e', 'n') with the same frequencies, just in a different order.
