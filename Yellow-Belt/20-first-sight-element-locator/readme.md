### Description
You are given an array of integers and a target integer. Your task is to implement a function that finds the first occurrence of the target integer in the array. If the target is found, return its 0-based index. If the target is not present in the array, return -1.

### Constraints
*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (where N is the number of elements in the array)
*   `-1000 <= ` `array[i]` `<= 1000`
*   `-1000 <= ` `target` `<= 1000`

### Example
#### Input:

5
10 20 30 40 50
30

#### Output:

2

#### Explanation:
The target value `30` is found at index `2` in the array `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.
