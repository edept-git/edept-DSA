### Description
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, "listen" is an anagram of "silent".

Your task is to implement a function that determines if two given strings are anagrams of each other. The strings will consist only of lowercase English letters.

### Constraints
- Both input strings, `s1` and `s2`, will contain only lowercase English letters ('a'-'z').
- The length of `s1` and `s2` will be between 0 and 10^5 characters, inclusive.

### Example
Input:
s1 = "rat"
s2 = "art"

Output:
true

Explanation:
Both "rat" and "art" use the letters 'a', 'r', and 't' exactly once.

### Concepts Covered
- Frequency Counting
- Character Arrays / Hash Maps
- String Manipulation
