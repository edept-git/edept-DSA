### Description
You are given an array of unique integers `nums`. Your task is to return all possible subsets (the power set) of this array. The order of the subsets and the order of elements within each subset do not matter. Duplicate subsets should not be included.

### Constraints
*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
*   All the integers in `nums` are unique.

### Example
#### Example 1:
Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
Output: `[[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]`

### Concepts Covered
*   Backtracking
*   Recursion
*   Decision Tree
*   Time and Space Complexity Analysis
