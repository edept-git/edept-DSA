### Description
You are given an array of integers `arr` and a target integer `target`. Your task is to implement a linear search algorithm to find the first occurrence of the `target` in the `arr`. If the `target` is found, return its 0-based index. If the `target` is not present in the array, return `-1`.

### Constraints
* `1 <= n <= 1000` (where `n` is the size of the array `arr`)
* `-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
* `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

### Example
**Input:**

5
10 20 30 40 50
30

**Output:**

2

**Explanation:**
The target `30` is found at index `2` in the array `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.

**Input:**

3
5 15 25
10

**Output:**

-1

**Explanation:**
The target `10` is not found in the array `[5, 15, 25]`.
