### Description
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence begins: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

Your task is to write a recursive function that calculates the Nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence starts at index 0 (so F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, etc.).

### Constraints
*   `0 <= N <= 20` (N is a non-negative integer)

### Example
**Input:**
`N = 5`

**Output:**
`5`

**Explanation:**
The Fibonacci sequence is:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1 (0 + 1)
F(3) = 2 (1 + 1)
F(4) = 3 (1 + 2)
F(5) = 5 (2 + 3)
