### Description
Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, return all possible combinations of `k` numbers chosen from the range `[1, n]`.

You may return the answer in any order. The combinations themselves should have their elements sorted in ascending order.

### Constraints
*   `1 <= k <= n <= 15`

### Example
**Input:**

n = 4, k = 2
