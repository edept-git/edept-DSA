### Description
You are given an array `nums` of distinct integers. Your task is to return all possible permutations of the numbers in `nums`. A permutation is an arrangement of all elements in a specific order. You can return the answer in any order.

### Constraints
* `1 <= nums.length <= 6`
* `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
* All the integers in `nums` are unique.

### Example
**Input:**

3
1 2 3


**Output:**

[[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]

*(The order of permutations in the output list may vary, but all must be present.)*

### Concepts Covered
*   Backtracking
*   Recursion
*   Depth-First Search (implicitly)
*   State Management
