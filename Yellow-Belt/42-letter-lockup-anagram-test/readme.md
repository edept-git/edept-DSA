### Description
You are given two strings, `s` and `t`. Your task is to determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`. An anagram is formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For this problem, assume the strings contain only lowercase English letters.

### Constraints
*   `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
*   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Example
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Explanation: "nagaram" can be formed by rearranging the letters of "anagram".

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
Explanation: "car" cannot be formed by rearranging "rat" (different letters).
